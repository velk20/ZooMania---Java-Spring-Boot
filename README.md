# ZooMania - Spring Boot Web Application with Java and MySQL

## :eyeglasses: Project Introduction
ZooMania is an online web (MVC) application where you can adopt your favorite pet. For Databse I am useing MySQL 8.0 with mysql-connector-j for Java compatibility and also Spring Data JPA with Hibernate for easier Database manimupations. Application is secured with Spring Security also custom configured in the project.
<br/><br/>

The backend is developed with Spring Boot with Java, and the frontend is built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. Also server side rendering is done by Thymeleaf.
-	The application requires a simple registration process to post an offer for adoption.
